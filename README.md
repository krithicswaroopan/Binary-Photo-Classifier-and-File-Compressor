# Load and predict an image
predictImage("sample_photo.jpg")
# Output: Displays image with label "photo" or "sign"
```

### Image Resizing
```python
# Resize image to target file size
resized_path = limit_image_memory(
    "large_image.jpg", 
    max_file_size=190000,  # 190KB
    delta=0.01  # 1% tolerance
)
```
